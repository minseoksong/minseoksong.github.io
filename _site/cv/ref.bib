abstract = {With the recent innovations in transportation, ridesourcing services have been proliferating in many countries. There are increasing attempts to apply ridesourcing in the corporate context. Manufacturing companies now install the Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) sensors to vehicles to obtain real-time data on the movement of goods and materials. Despite the massive amount of data accumulated, little attention has been paid to exploiting the data for vehicle fleet management (FM). This paper proposes an analytical framework to solve two FM problems: how to group organizational units for vehicle sharing and where to deploy the groups. The framework is then validated with a case study of a Korean shipbuilder. The results indicate that grouping departments with similar spatial patterns can reduce the current fleet.},

abstract = {A clinical pathway (CP) is a tool for effectively managing a care process. There are several research efforts on developing clinical pathways (CPs) in the process mining domain. However, the nature of the data affects data analysis results, and patient clinical variability makes it challenging to develop CPs. Thus, it is crucial to determine candidate care processes that can be standardized as CPs before applying process mining techniques. This paper proposed a method for assessing CP feasibility regarding clinical complexity using clinical order logs from electronic health records. The proposed method consists of data preparation, activity & trace homogeneity evaluations, and process inspection using process mining. Each step consists of metrics to measure the homogeneity of processes and a visualization method to demonstrate the diversity of processes based on the log. The case study was conducted with five surgical groups of patients from a tertiary hospital in South Korea to validate the proposed method. The five groups of patients were successfully assessed. In addition, the visualization methods helped clinical experts grasp the diversity of care processes.},

abstract = {Process mining techniques can be used to analyse business processes using the data logged during their execution. These techniques are leveraged in a wide range of domains, including healthcare, where it focuses mainly on the analysis of diagnostic, treatment, and organisational processes. Despite the huge amount of data generated in hospitals by staff and machinery involved in healthcare processes, there is no evidence of a systematic uptake of process mining beyond targeted case studies in a research context. When developing and using process mining in healthcare, distinguishing characteristics of healthcare processes such as their variability and patient-centred focus require targeted attention. Against this background, the Process-Oriented Data Science in Healthcare Alliance has been established to propagate the research and application of techniques targeting the data-driven improvement of healthcare processes. This paper, an initiative of the alliance, presents the distinguishing characteristics of the healthcare domain that need to be considered to successfully use process mining, as well as open challenges that need to be addressed by the community in the future.},

Abstract ={Health information exchange (HIE) refers to the integrated management and secure sharing of health information among healthcare entities. HIE improves healthcare quality and streamlines healthcare administrative work. These advantages have propelled health- care stakeholders to implement HIE. However, challenged by issues such as security, privacy, and costs, HIE is not widespread. Recent studies have suggested blockchain-based HIE for solving security and privacy issues. Unfortunately, existing blockchain-based HIE studies do not consider the privacy issues caused by analyzing senders and receivers of transactions in the blockchain. In this work, we suggest MEXchange, a novel blockchain-based privacy-preserving HIE that prevents the privacy issue by obscuring the sender and concealing receiver addresses. We propose smart contracts and workflow that use ring signature and stealth address for blockchain-based HIE. Software components and implementation of MEXchange on the Ethereum private network are discussed. We evaluate MEXchange quantitatively by measuring the transaction latency and throughput of exchanging. Also, we evaluate MEXchange qualitatively using the requirements of the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). Moreover, we proceed with threat modeling based on STRIDE. Finally, we compare MEXchange with Ancile, FHIRChain, Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (IHE XDS), and MedRec. The MEXchange lowers barriers to the application of blockchain-based HIE systems by mitigating privacy and security issues among healthcare stakeholders.},

abstract = {The aim of this research was to analyze the player’s pass style with enhanced accuracy using the deep learning technique. We proposed Pass2vec, a passing style descriptor that can characterize each player’s passing style by combining detailed information on passes. Pass data was extracted from the ball event data from five European football leagues in the 2017–2018 season, which was divided into training and test set. The information on location, length, and direction of passes was combined using Convolutional Autoencoder. As a result, pass vectors were generated for each player. We verified the method with the player retrieval task, which successfully retrieved 76.5\% of all players in the top-20 with the descriptor and the result outperformed previous methods. Also, player similarity analysis confirmed the resemblance of players passes on three representative cases, showing the actual application and practical use of the method. The results prove that this novel method for characterizing player’s styles with improved accuracy will enable us to understand passing better for player training and recruitment.},

  abstract={In semiconductor manufacturing, data-driven methodologies have enabled the resolution of various issues, particularly yield management and enhancement. Yield, one of the crucial key performance indicators in semiconductor manufacturing, is mostly affected by production resources, i.e., equipment involved in the process. There is a lot of research on finding the correlation between yield and the status of resources. However, in general, multiple resources are engaged in production processes, which may cause multicollinearity among resources. Therefore, it is important to discover resource paths that are positively or negatively associated with yield. This article proposes a systematic methodology for discovering a resource-oriented transition system model in a semiconductor manufacturing process to identify resource paths resulting in high and low yield. The proposed method is based on the model-based analysis (i.e., finite state machine mining) in process mining and statistical analyses. We conducted an empirical study with real-life data from one of the leading semiconductor manufacturing companies to validate the proposed approach.},
